Homework 3

1.
	a. The service is RESTful. Using CRUD http requests, the stateless endpoints send JSON via url.
	b. v1/player/# and v1/player - both are idempotent and nullipotent, they do not change when requests are made.
	c. The JDBC Object model takes a relational postgress database and maps it into an object, so there is evidence that it works.
	d. Not currently, the requests only send information and does not insert anything into its database.

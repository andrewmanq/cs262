Homework 3
reviewing ClamminTroops

2.
	a. The project management materials show that all members are participating. Each card is clear and concise.
	b. The updated domain model is more informative. I'd like to see some footnotes of how these elements interact with each other, but that's not exactly a requrement for the model itself. An all-to all relationship makes sense for the app.
	The database makes sense, and every class has a unique id. The references are correct and the example entries are useful.
	c. Not much code has been committed recently, and it was only committed by one person. The code runs though, and works perfectly fine.
	d. The design presentation worked very well. The slides might have been a little distracting at times, but they were funny and I don't mind a little humor. I enjoyed when Gavin "accidentally" called it Tinder. The live demo was great, and I could not find anything wrong with the overall presentation. I think theirs was the best one.
